        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a recent graduate of the Engineering Flex program at Thinkful and avid tech enthusiast.
           Programming has become my life as I find immense joy from solving problems and understanding new technologies. 
           The thrill of finding answers to questions drives me to be continually learning and perfecting my skills as a software engineer. 
           There is no better feeling than having an ambitious idea and bringing it to fruition.</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding, I am generally painting or hiking in the wilderness. I love learning and often listen to podcasts about AI, 
          futurism, neuroscience and other existential topics.</p>
